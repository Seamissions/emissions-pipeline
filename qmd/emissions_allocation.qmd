# Methods

-   For each year, calculate total **non-broadcasting** emissions for each FAO region:

`fao_summary_non_broadcasting`

-   Then divy that up to *all* fisheries that report catch in that region (proportionally by the weight of catch in each fishery).

TABLE 1: `total_region_non_broad_allocation`

-   For each year, calculate total **broadcasting** emissions, by country, for each FAO region.

TABLE 2: `emissions_partitioned`

-   Full join the allocated non-broadcasting emissions with the broadcasting emissions.

TABLE 3: `total_region_emissions`

Assumptions:

-   Within an FAO region, the non-broadcasting emissions are spread proportionally across *all* fisheries and countries within that region *by catch*.
