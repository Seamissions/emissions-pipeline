# Methods:

- For each year, calculate total **non-broadcasting** emissions for each FAO region:  `fao_summary_non_broadcasting`
- Then divy that up to *all* fisheries that report catch in that region (proportionally by the amount of catch in each fishery). TABLE 1: `total_region_non_broad_allocation`
- For each year, calculate total **broadcasting** emissions, by country, for each FAO region. TABLE 2: `emissions_partitioned`
- Full join the allocated non-broadcasting emissions with the broadcasting emissions. TABLE 3: `total_region_emissions`

Assumptions:

- Within an FAO region, the non-broadcasting emissions are spread proportionally across *all* fisheries and countries within that region *by catch*.
