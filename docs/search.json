    "section": "",
    "text": "1 About\nGlobal fisheries are heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the rise in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions driving climate change. While satellite technology is commonly used to monitor land-based emissions (and ocean-based emissions of shipping vessels), studies primarily estimating ocean-based emissions remain limited in the fishing sector. In collaboration with the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) and Global Fishing Watch (GFW), this project leverages novel, high-resolution, satellite-based datasets to provide precise insights into the GHG emissions associated with global fisheries. We develop a reproducible, extensible, and open-source data processing pipeline to connect emissions data with seafood production data, along with an interactive dashboard to explore the resulting dataset. Our findings will enable novel research opportunities, offer actionable data to identify major GHG contributors, and facilitate new policy and market-based interventions to reduce fisheries-related emissions at scale.\nThis analysis was conducted as a part of UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management Master of Environmental Data Science Capstone project.\n\n\n2 Objectives\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a reproducible pipeline to quantify GHG emissions associated with global seafood production, linking fishing vessel emissions data to species-specific FAO seafood production statistics. This dataset aims to provide emissions estimates for 9 GHG and non-GHG pollutants by FAO region, year, country, and species. Additionally, the project seeks to enhance the usability and accessibility of these data through an interactive dashboard, enabling targeted regulatory, policy, and market-based interventions to reduce the carbon footprint associated with global seafood production.\nProducts & Deliverables\n\nEmissions Processing Pipeline: Reproducible, extensible, and open-source data processing pipeline to estimate GHG emissions from global seafood production by harmonizing emLab’s high-resolution vessel emissions data, including both AIS-broadcasting and non-broadcasting vessels, with FAO catch records.\nSeamissions Dashboard: Interactive public dashboard to visualize the relationships between GHG emissions and fishing vessel type, flag, catch species, and FAO region.\nResults Report: Comprehensive written assessment comparing the project’s emissions estimates with existing published data.\n\n\n\n3 Authors\nWe are a team of environmental data scientists working to quantify and demystify the emissions contributed through commercial fishing fleets.\nCarmen Hoyt Bren Profile | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website\nNicole Pepper Bren Profile | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website\nStephen Carroll Bren Profile | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website\nJosh Mull Bren Profile | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website"

This, however, does have implications for the non-broadcasting dataset (see…).\nISSCAAP groups 41 and 51, representing freshwater crustaceans and freshwater molluscs respectively, as well as the species “River eels”, were filtered out because any emissions associated with freshwater collection are eliminated during the intersection of the FAO regions shapefile and the emissions grid. Therefore, it is assumed that none of the resulting emissions can be attributed to fishing for freshwater species."

Then, the datasets were concatenated.\nA year column was created, and the combined dataset was filtered to 2016 and beyond to match the available data for the non-broadcasting dataset. Emissions estimates are then aggregated (summed) by year and flag for each one-by-one degree pixel (distinguished by lat_bin and lon_bin)."

Additionally, this assumes that non-broadcasting emissions are directly proportional to the proportion of catch weight (in tons) by fishery (species-flag combo) and that the different gear types used to target the various fisheries have the same rate of emissions-per-unit-catch. For broadcasting emissions that are divided out proportionally among reported catch (by weight), we assume that all of a country’s catch is reported and that emissions rates are the same for each species (when in reality, emissions estimates may vary the different gear types used to target individual fisheries)."
