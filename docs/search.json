    "text": "4.1 Join Emissions Data\nEmissions datasets (datasets 1 and 2 above) were read into the pipeline, the column names were converted to snake case, and a new year-month column was created for both datasets. In the broadcasting dataset, NA values in the flag column were filled with “UNK” to represent flag unknown, and vessel_class was filtered for gear types identified with a high degree of confidence (i.e. “squid_jigger”, “drifting_longlines”, “pole_and_line”, “trollers”, “pots_and_traps”, “set_longlines”, “set_gillnets”, “trawlers”, “dredge_fishing”, “tuna_purse_seines”, “other_purse_seines”, “other_seines”). This eliminated gear types such as “passenger” that were likely mis-identified as “fishing” or as “passenger” by GFW’s machine learning algorithm.\n\n\n [1] \"trawlers\"           \"set_longlines\"      \"drifting_longlines\"\n [4] \"trollers\"           \"squid_jigger\"       \"pots_and_traps\"    \n [7] \"other_seines\"       \"pole_and_line\"      \"other_purse_seines\"\n[10] \"tuna_purse_seines\"  \"set_gillnets\"       \"dredge_fishing\"    \n[13] NA                  \n\n\nIn the non-broadcasting dataset, emissions estimate columns for each of the 9 pollutants (CO2, CH4, N2O, NOX, SOX, CO, VOCS, PM2.5, PM10) are renamed to match the broadcasting dataset, and a flag column is created and populated with “DARK” to distinguish non-broadcasting emissions from the broadcasting emissions. Then, the datasets were concatenated.\nA year column was created, and the combined dataset was filtered to 2016-2024 to match the available data for the non-broadcasting dataset. Emissions estimates are then aggregated (summed) by year and flag for each one-by-one degree pixel (distinguished by lat_bin and lon_bin)."

An empty grid was generated from the point geometry, the emissions data were joined back to the empty grid, and the geodataframe was transformed to Equal Earth projection. Every grid cell was assigned a unique ID. Using the FAO shapefile (dataset 3), an intersection was run on the emissions grid cells to assign each to an FAO region. Some grid cells overlapped multiple regions, resulting in multipolygons for those grid cell IDs. Multipolygons were broken down into individual sub-polygons.

Some emissions are expected to be lost due to floating point error and rounding, and 0.001% was arbitrarily selected as a threshold (though the actual number of lost emissions is likely much smaller)."
